title: "For Helen"
---

- The Dracaena plant Helen gave us years ago died in
- the same week Helen died.

- How lucky the mother plant left behind two offspring
- to keep a shaded corner of our room less solemn.
- Much like Helen chose to brighten a space in the life
- of her friends.

- Yet, Iâ€™m compelled to question why the mourning time
- has been too brief, why sadness gains so little space with a loss so great.

- It must be that mystical place of darkness and grief
- is flooded with light each time we remember Helen.
