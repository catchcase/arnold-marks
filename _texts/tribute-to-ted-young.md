title: "Tribute to Ted Young"
---

- My name is Arnold Marks. My wife, Santa, and I met Ted Young 
- ten years ago at Mayank and Harshita’s wedding in Kolkata, India.

- Ted was a neighbor of Harshita while she was till a student at Moore College of 
- Art.

- Santa got to know Harshita, also when she was still studying at Moore, and 
- doing craft shows at Blue Cross Headquarters and Head House on Pine Street.

- But there is no doubt it was Harshita’s wedding that eventually brought us all 
- together in friendship.
- A kind of love fest it was.
- A Philly love fest in India.
- And Ted loved every day of it.
- And so did we all.
- Standing here I have to admit,
- It’s hard knowing he is no longer with us.

- We all had respect for him as a caring person.
- We admired him for his knowledge and love of art.
- We always enjoyed his company and the company of his friends and relatives we 
- met along the way.
- And where ART was concerned, he let it all hang out.
- We loved that about him too.

- This day we will raise a toast to Ted Young.
- And we will be grateful for the friendship he offered us; and wish him well on 
- his final journey.
