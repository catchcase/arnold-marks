title: "For Grandma Moses on Her Birthday"
---

- This is my story of Anna M. Robertson 
- a lady I think you should know. 
- Critics called her too childlike 
- untrained and wild-like 
- not having too much 
- or too far to go.

- But little old Anna was very profound 
- when she began painting around all around 
- when Anna M. painted her town.

- She was born in the days
-  of the blues and the grays.
-  Her first years were spent on the farm 
- She milked her white cow 
- and slopped the black sow 
- doodling at night with some yarn.

- Dear little Anna was getting profound 
- as she began doodling around all around 
- as Anna M. painted her town.

- Now Anna grew up had kids of her own 
- out of eight some were handsome some homely.
-  When her children were grown
-  got hitched and left home 
- poor Anna felt useless and lonely.

- But our little Anna was far too profound 
- so she started painting around all around
-  Anna began painting her town.

- Her work first appeared in a pharmacy window
-  at Hoosick Falls town in the hills. 
- A stranger on passing through 
- not sure of what to do 
- bought a few paintings and pills.

- He thought little Anna was awfully profound 
- on seeing her pictures around all around
- and how she had painted her town.

- At first people looked upon her as naive 
- calling her work quite askew.
-  But she didn’t mind and they grew to find 
- Cezanne’s a Van Gogh’s work was too.

- Yes little old Anna was surly profound 
- when she began painting around all around 
- when she began painting her town.

- As time passed we loved her 
- called her our own.
-  Four presidents called her to town. 
- She gave them a picture 
- they quoted some scripture 
- the picture has never come down.

- Little old Anna was very profound 
- when she began painting around all around
-  when she began painting our town.

- She started her folio at seventy-six 
- in twenty six years she was through. 
- She laid down her brushes 
- with colors so luscious 
- and died at one hundred and one.

- Our little old Anna was oh! so profound
-  when she finished painting around all around. 
- When Anna M. Robertson painted our town.
