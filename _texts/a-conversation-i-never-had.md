title: "A Conversation I never Had With My Cardiologist or Why Surgeons Don't Say Much"
---

I waited ten, maybe fifteen minutes for the doctor to arrive. Not unusual; often a patient just takes longer than anticipated. But how does one kill time while sitting on a cold examination table, in a cold room, staring at a blank wall? Naturally, I began humming an old favorite tune. I think it was one from Showboat. “He must know something but don’t say nothin.” Yeah, that was it; that one from Showboat.

Finally, the door opened.

“Hello Doctor; How are you?”

My usual greeting.

“Hi Mr. Marks, nice to see you.”

His usual greeting.

“Let’s see.” He said thoughtfully, getting comfortable with his laptop.

“It’s been six months since I saw you last; have you had any unusual discomfort in the chest area?”

“To be honest Doc, the annoyance caused by the Hiatal Hernia has taken my mind off my other problems; except for my bunions. But don’t get me started.”

“Good, let’s check your blood pressure.”

“Pressure normal.”

“Yea, it’s always been normal; except maybe during sex. Like I said it’s always normal.”

“Okay”, the doctor replied with a noticeable sigh as he again studied his electronic list. “I see all the lab work is in the normal range; that’s a good sign. Do you still get leg cramps at night from the Statin medicine?”

“Unfortunately, I do! Sometimes it’s so painful it hurts to get off the bed to work it out. The only reason I’m staying on it is because my G.P. got very upset when I told him I was going to stop taking it. I don’t like to make him angry; I figure I might need him someday.”

“Well, you should stay with it. It’s good for you.”

“Yes, I know; pain can be cleansing.”

“Say Doc, I recently read an article in the hospital publication. It had to do with studies involving vein grafts from the legs as a substitute for blocked coronary arteries. I was surprised to see the results showed failure rates of 40% to 50% after two years. Isn’t that the same surgery I had two and a half years ago?”

“Well, not exactly, Mr. Marks. The study involved patients who had cardiac events of some kind; like a clot or a heart attack. Your heart is relatively healthy.”

“Are there any statistics available yet concerning my type of case?”

“Come, come now, Mr. Marks, have you ever heard the one about used cars?”

“No Doc, but if you were Woody Allen, himself, I wouldn’t care to hear that joke right now.”

“Now, now Mr. Marks. We don’t have all the answers yet. But you should know it’s patients like you who, in the end, will help us discover those answers.”

“I’m really happy about that Doc, but I’m a little superstitious. Could you just give me a little hint?”

“Should I make my next appointment for 12 months?”

“No.”

“Nine months?” “No.”

“Six months?”

“Please see the receptionist on the way out, Mr. Marks.”

“We’ll be touch.”

“Thanks Doc, have a good day.”
My usual farewell.

“And you as well Mr. Marks.”
The Doctor’s usual farewell.
