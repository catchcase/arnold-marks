title: "Humanomics"
---

- I see us all 
- an armada sailing on Keynesian Seas 
- in fragile vessels 
- dreaming distant dreams
-  Each of us sharing 
- fitful calms and frightful storms
-  with little hope of ever reaching port 
- Have faith 
- our preachers plead
-  knowing well
-  when our voyage ends 
- the difference between us
-  will be recorded on disposable disks 
- in one giant computer 
- and what was once 
- the vital journey we shared 
- will soon be forgotten.
