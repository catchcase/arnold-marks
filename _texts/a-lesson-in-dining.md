title: "A Lesson in Dining"
---

In a recent conversation with my Grandson, Kenan, about where he might take his prom date for dinner, I suggested Morton's of Chicago might be a little too expensive for his wallet. What I didn't know was he had already made up his mind. I can afford a $125.00 Pop, he said, with a stubborn, self-assurance of a 17-year-old that reminded me of his father a hundred years ago. Never mind he had to work more than a week part time in the shoe store to save those dollars. But unlike the reaction I am certain I would have displayed with his father, I ended the discussion in a typical grandfatherly way by wishing him a wonderful time while admonishing him to be sure to have enough cash in his pocket to avoid embarrassment.

Soon after the auspicious weekend was over, his mother called to inform us how the plans had worked out. She was told the service was great, the steak outstanding and the check was well over three hundred dollars for the three couples in the party. At the end of the evening, Kenan gathered the cash from his friends and presented it to the waiter. In a short time, the waiter returned, and placed the entire amount of the check on the table. They listened wide-eyed, as the waiter explained that a couple several tables away had paid for their dinner. The couple told the ma√Ætre when they were on their prom date many years before, someone had picked up their check, and they decided to do the same for them.

For six young students, the evening turned out to be more than fun, camaraderie and a good time. Just as important, I think, was the lesson they had in caring and generosity, perhaps not taught often enough in the classrooms.
