title: "Vignettes"
---

- It looks like I’m destined
- To work till I drop dead
- I can only hope I begin
- Hallucinating before I
- feel any pain.

- A friend of mine told me
- The other day he hadn’t had
- sex with his wife
- in over 10 years
- when I asked him how that
- could possibly happen
- He said they have been waiting
- For Viagra to go
- Over-the-counter.
- Ba Dumm!

- Generally speaking,
- my poetry tends to be 
- rather brief;
- characteristic of my memory,
- my attention span, as well as my
- stature.
