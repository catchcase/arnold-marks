title: "Sunscape - August"
---

- The sun falls 
- below the skyline quickly 
- splashing up the colors 
- of the universe 
- while I dream of songs 
- coming naturally 
- like asking why 
- And I wonder why
-  we wait so long 
- to celebrate miracles 
- calmly letting precious 
- moments pass 
- when all that life can give 
- flows from the colors
-  in the eternal sun.
