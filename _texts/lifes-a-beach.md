title: "Life's a Beach"
---

When we were children growing up in Atlantic City the beaches were wide and seemed to be level with the ocean and only the force of a spring tide or occasional storm could coax the water into the streets. It was almost predictable even in the minds of the children we were then. We thought we knew the beaches and the water well. Summers’ hottest days drew us to one beach then another until over time each one became a unique acquaintance competing for our personal rating and pleasure. Were there many shells in the water? Was the beach too crowded? Were the waves high? Were there sandbars? How strict were the lifeguards? There was this mental checklist we referred to regularly. We knew it well growing up.

One day a strange looking ship appeared off the shoreline of our Inlet neighborhood. At first we thought it was a clam boat like the ones that periodically passed by on their way to the clam beds in distant waters. But within a short time, we began noticing large pipes strewn along one beach then another. We learned later that the anchored ship had begun the endless task of holding back the ocean. We thought we knew the beaches and the water well, but we never realized over time, in our time, the beaches were slowly disappearing and the ocean had been reclaiming the space it had once generously provided.

Ships have been pumping sand back onto the beaches of Atlantic City for 60 years and beyond; still erosion persists. In certain areas, beach and ocean are hidden from the boardwalk sight line by what appear to be hills of sand. They are in fact artificial sand dunes constructed by pumping sand into huge rubber bladders; then covering them with sand and appropriate vegetation. The last line of defense against a rising ocean? Unlikely. History shows the engineers’ imagination is limited only by available funding.

We, as children, thought we knew the beaches and water. We have come to realize the future of Atlantic City’s once grand beaches is not predictable, after all, and far from promising. Knowing we will not be witness to how it all ends is no longer the disconcerting thought it was once.
