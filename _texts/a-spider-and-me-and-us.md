title: "A Spider And Me And Us"
---

- Waiting for a bus one day
- I saw a tiny black spider
- smaller than the pimple on my nose
- climbing up a slippery wall
- pausing briefly then to see
- who it was who stopped in wonder
- just to watch if it should fall
- of course that one was me.

- As I wondered looking up so high
- what goal this creature sought
- when choosing this dubious path
- this wall so tall and shear
- would it decide to continue or stop
- or was it merely testing me
- to see if I might come
- and follow its lead to the very top?

- That tiny spider would not let go
- even though the bus was moving now
- and thinking back as there I sat
- I thought not quite out loud
- As far as I could see
- we are all that tiny black spider
- and in the very same way
- that tiny black spider was me.
