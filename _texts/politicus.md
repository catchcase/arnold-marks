title: "Politicus"
---

- Who are those piteous people in the Ring
- And who are they who sit above screaming?
- What did they ask of them to bring
- What tortures are they scheming?

- Why are they in this bloody place
- In the rags they are all wearing?
- Did they choose to be a brunt of shame
- With not a shred of caring?

- The lions no longer guard the gate
- That age has passed forever.
- Yet Politicus lives on in heartless minds
- Wonâ€™t they one day see the truth
- or never?
