title: "Memories of an Old Song"
---

- We love the best we can 
- there is no measuring
-  no beginning 
- no end.
-  Memories of love and loving 
- crowd our conscious lives
-  moment to moment. 
- Try once to recall
-  the more perfect love of all.
-  The mind persistently strains 
- to bring us back 
- where love is now. 
- Persistently strains 
- Persistently.
