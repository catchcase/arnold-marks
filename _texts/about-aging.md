title: "About Aging"
---

- Aging is not about skin
- In all the wrong places,
- Or keloids and bumps
- In mysterious places,
- Nor only of muscles
- we frequently strain,
- Or even our head
- Thatâ€™s often in pain,
- Forget for now doctors,
- nurses and pills,
- And all the rest
- That come with our ills,
- Aging Is about those who have left us.
