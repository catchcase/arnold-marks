title: "War Games"
---

- Have you ever wondered where peace
-  hides when war is the game? Did you 
- know the war men play is like a game 
- much like children play but not quite the 
- same? As though there is a secret hiding
-  place wherein peace hides patiently until 
- discovered at some unexpected hour. Or 
- must the game play out to rules of a higher 
- power? The players in this war game season
-  move in shadow and darkness, solitary and 
- alienated from hope and reason. The game 
- can end only when life wins over death.
