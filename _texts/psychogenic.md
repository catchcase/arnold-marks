- I sometimes feel my plants speak to me in inexplicable ways, but of course I could never confess this to you knowing what your response would be.

- But sitting on my terrace in evening shade one well-done day in July, I found myself turning this way and that as the sun was about to fade.

- Ah!, the watering can after all is near and I somehow came to know the wilted flowers of the begonias were unhappy and without their ration would surely sear.

- But you my friend should have no problem with me; witness Ivy knowing what little Kira needs without words exchanged between the two, much like me and my plants you see.
