title: "A Lifeguard's Lament"
---

- Living near the sea then not
-  has made longing my constant companion

- I miss seeing the sun's first light
-  streaking over dark water to the beach 
- like a spotlight on a grand stage

- I miss being on a becalmed sea at dawn 
- and listening to a silence unmatched by forests

- I miss the thunderous echo of stormy seas 
- wild and foaming deadly whitecaps 
- unpredictable west wind hollow backs 
- straining to regain old boundaries

- I miss the serenity of patient relentless seas 
- weaving endlessly around sturdiest timbers 
- weaving–wearing–liquefying

- I miss hearing the sensuous hypnotic 
- wishing-wishing-wishing sound 
- of dying seas in darkness 
- as once powerful waves spent at last 
- with a final sigh 
- surrender to the loving shore.
