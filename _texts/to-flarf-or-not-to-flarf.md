title: "To Flarf or not to Flarf"
---

- After serious study I see Flarfing going down something like this:  All those wasted hours surfing useless and irrelevant websites need not be totally lost.

- As it happens, somewhere between the brain and the viscous fluid of the eyeballs exist captive words, even an idea or two which could become useful at some future date.

- So, eventually, often for no apparent cause and on no specific occasion a word or an idea totally arbitrary and disconnected from everything else can be spewed out onto the blank page of one’s journal. Voila, Poetry!

- A poet by the name of Donald Reveil suggests, “We must not look for poetry in poems.”

- Well, all I can say is, Donald you saved my ass.
