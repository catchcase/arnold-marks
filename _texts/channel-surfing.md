- I see myself there but 
- I am not there.
- What I mean is
-  I was there.
- Now I only dream 
- about what was.
- And who I was then 
- and who I am now.
- My dreams are transient 
- like leaving home and returning.
- Or like T.V. channels 
- Switching in my brain,
- On and off
-  On and off.
- I often see myself 
- I see myself there.

- I see myself there as a child 
- standing beside Jimmy Black 
- on the sandy bank of the creek 
- where tall cedars strained to
-  reach over rouge tinted water 
- flowing quietly on its way 
- from where we never knew or cared 
- but instinctively understood 
- being in that place 
- where the water and the plants 
- and the trees were 
- was a good thing.

- Hearing this might take you back but my first
- real friend was Jimmy Black.
- His family lived in a splintery box
- that had no paint and had no locks.
- The war was on some called it great
- while we just swung on the backyard gate.
- One winter’s day we moved away.
- What year it was I cannot say.
- I only know on looking back
- I have not since seen Jimmy Black.
