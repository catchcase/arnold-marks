When the time comes for me to leave my final
job at Penn Center House, one of the most 
poignant memories I will take with me is that 
most of the individuals I came to know through 
the years at that time were either in the hospital, 
soon to be admitted to the hospital or had only 
recently been discharged from the hospital.
