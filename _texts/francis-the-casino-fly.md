title: "Francis the Casino Fly (An Adult Fable)"
---

On a hot afternoon in late July, Francis the Fly was keeping himself busy around the garbage behind the little house (somehow, flies always seem to appear to be busy).
Quite by accident he came upon a huge pile of "crap" piled high on the shoulder of the road next to the little house. It was a sunny day and the asphalt was hot and the air smelled a lot. Just a perfect all-around day for flies. Francis could not have been happier as he flitted all day for flying carefree above and around the aromatic mound. His relatives, about a hundred altogether, leisurely passed time in the garbage at the rear of the little house.

Typical of ordinary house files - and Francis was about as ordinary as a house fly could be - the family rarely strayed far from their birthplace. Francis was born on a chicken bone just a few days earlier. He was quite content spending warm days among the smelly stuff in the garbage behind the little house.

As far as the family was concerned, life was good. And if Francis hadn't strayed a little because of a sudden, totally unexpected breeze, he would still be playing happily in the garbage with his brothers and sisters. But on that one, fateful day, everything changed.

One minute he was enjoying lunch on a sardine can, and the next minute he was sitting on a pile of "crap" on the shoulder of the highway next to the little house.
And strangely enough, when he looked around, everything he learned to recognize was gone. He might as well have been in another world. At first, Francis was frightened. But the day was too warm and the smells were too strong for fear to prevail. He was soon happily, daringly flittering and fluttering around his very own pile of "crap" as if nothing happened.

Suddenly, Francis was startled by a loud screeching sound as a powerful draft nearly slammed him to the ground. A big black limo had made a sudden stop not ten feet away, nearly brushing his wings. He was lucky to be alive.

Now, curiosity getting the better of him (flies are awfully curious), Francis buzzed over to see what it was that intruded into his space.

Attracted by sweet, unfamiliar smells he flew through the open door of the limo to get a better smell of things. Just as he was about to leave, the door slammed shut. Francis was trapped. For what seemed to be an eternity, he was suspended in midair in a speeding car (he wondered how he could do that).

He tried desperately to regain his balance. He instinctively flew up as a great rush of air came towards him from above. Then another from below. There were loud claps, like thunder, one after another.

Of course Francis had to no way of knowing someone was trying to do him in. He only knew he had to regain his balance with each rush of air. Finally recovering, he dove down fast and straight for the floor. There he found refuge in the folds of a beach bag. Tired and shaking from fright, Francis fell asleep dreaming he was playing among the garbage cans behind the little house. A wonderful day had nearly turned tragic. But there was more to come.
His dreaming ended abruptly when the bag Francis was sleeping on suddenly jerked upward and everything in the limo began moving all at once.

The limo had stopped in front of a towering building. Francis hung tightly to the bag. All the occupants, including Francis, went through a door with the sign above proclaiming — "Casino Entrance".

Of course since Francis was a country fly by birth, the felt completely overwhelmed by the endless vibrations and strange smells and flashing lights. The garbage and his family behind the little house was quickly becoming nothing more than a distant memory (flies have terrible memories). Already he was beginning to feel at home in the casino.

He began exploring the many rooms in the place. Not surprisingly he found his way to the kitchen.

Now here were smells, delicious beyond his wildest imagination. He did recognize a few like the chicken and tuna and of course, sardines. Not having eaten in over an hour, Francis suddenly realized he was famished. He became wildly excited, streaking from one spot to another, trying to savor every smell at once. Finally, he chose as his appetizer, a piece of beef filet lying in a puddle of blood under a table. Too impatient, he was soon darting in every direction again under the spell of this smell and that smell; until he was finally exhausted.

Ironically, he came to rest on a chicken bone in a garbage can. And all his fond memories returned.

He was soon flittering again from one place to another, eventually settling on a bunch of very bright lights. He clung nervously to a piece of glass; part of a chandelier high above the vast and noisy casino floor. As it happened, directly below his lofty perch he stared, mesmerized by an almost rhythmic movement of two tiny red objects flying across a bright green surface (flies like bright surfaces). He watched, riveted to the movement of the swiftly moving objects. Curiosity, finally getting the best of him (files are very curious), Francis timed his descent to land on one of the little red objects just as it came to rest. He realized, too late, he had hesitated a second too long. He never felt the lethal blow that came crashing down from above. Someone standing around the table, nonchalantly, flicked his lifeless little corpse to the soft carpeted floor below.

It was of course more than sad that Francis the Curious Fly from the country had to die in such a tragic way, all alone, so far from home.

Perhaps, we can find some solace in the fact he left us with a poignant and universal lesson, which is:  It is better to live with the crap one must endure at home than it is to risk one’s life in a crap game in a strange place far away.
