title: "A Very Personal Obituary"
---

Harry Segal, a childhood friend, took his life the other day. He did it with the help of drugs, and it took a long time. Some suggested he had a heart attack. That may be true, but his close friends knew he had been doing himself in for many years and there was little anyone could do to help him. Harry could be more than a little stubborn.

I could speculate why he decided it was unimportant to him whether or not he lived a long and healthy life. But all that would be irrelevant now.

The end came September 1, 1986, a few months before his 50th birthday.

There was no formal announcement of his death; no funeral; no period of mourning. His body was cremated the day after he died. I knew it was the way he wanted it. He abhorred the practice of making a fuss over what he felt should be a very private affair.

In the weeks following his death, I was often aware of a deep and terrible sadness. I felt guilt because I had no opportunity to help him. And I was disappointed that he would choose to permanently separate himself from family and friends.

The last time I saw Harry was two years ago at our 30th high school reunion. He had a sickly look about him then. I suggested he take better care of himself. He smiled and said he was trying. He stared at me intently for a time as if he were contemplating an appropriate repartee. His arms were folded against his chest in a manner some how reminiscent to me. Our conversation ended as he slowly moved in an unsteady shuffle to another part of the large room.

The last time we spoke was last spring. He called me at my office on a busy Friday afternoon.

I sensed a weakness in his voice. He talked about the importance of luck in our lives. He said, "There should be more to life than the dull routine we have to contend with every day." He told me how he had speculated years ago on some acreage in the New Jersey Meadowlands, and that he recently sold it for a million dollars. He said he was having a sailing ketch built in Tahiti and planned to spend the rest of his life sailing around the world.

Our conversation ended with his invitation to the bon voyage party he planned to throw at the Atlantic City Marina before setting sail on his adventure.

That phone call turned out to be Harry's farewell to me. A finale to the life he lived so successfully on one level, yet so tenuously on another.

I will always be grateful I had the opportunity to speak to my old friend one last time. We will all miss not seeing him at his party.
