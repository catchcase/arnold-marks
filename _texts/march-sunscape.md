title: "March Sunscape"
---

- How small the winter’s sun 
- pinned high above the city 
- like the polished silver broach 
- I saw in a fancy jeweler’s window. 
- Shivering with light 
- it fails to bow 
- as if the earth 
- too cold to touch
-  it keeps at measured length 
- there waiting a little longer
-  a little longer still 
- until at last we long to feel 
- her fiery glow.
