title: "A Seagull as Pacifist"
---

- She stands at water’s edge, still 
- as if in expectation 
- watching the dunes above
- where her brothers screech
-  their warnings. 
- Their eyes wide in fearful threat 
- heads cocked to strike
-  with sword-like beaks
-  the feathered Samurai. 
- There at water’s edge 
- she seems content to rest her tired feet 
- in gentle ripples of dying waves. 
- Something down beach attracts her gaze. 
- Leaning hard into the wind 
- she deftly moves toward a clutch 
- of mussels clinging to pilings 
- now above water’s reach 
- all the while invisible
-  to that warrior band above
-  fighting furiously over bread and bologna
