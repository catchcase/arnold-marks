title: "A Picture Is Worth A Few Words"
---

While trying to determine the ownership of an old suitcase that came into the mail room recently, I was surprised to learn that inside was a large collection of someone’s old family photographs. It brought back memories of my mother’s collection. She kept it in a large unlocked drawer in her vanity bureau. The sweet smells of cedar and cologne still remain a part of my sensory keepsakes.

As a child, I spent many rainy days happily picking through the hundreds of picture-toys, fascinated by so many unfamiliar faces and places.  Unsmiling men in black tuxedos; attractive women (some not so attractive) in fancy fashions of the day; children in clothes so unlike my own, all somehow managed to capture my interest.  Many of those photographs would be over 100 years old today.

With a child’s curiosity, I would often ask my mother the name of some particular individual, or place and she would say, “Oh, I think that was a neighbor of ours in Denmark”, or, “That looks like a friend’s house in Montreal many years ago.”  But for the most part, names and places and time were even then becoming only vague reflections of her memories.

My mother’s photographs, like those in the old suitcase told little or nothing about who, or when, or where they were taken. Information that might, in the distant future, give a curious progeny some insight into her family’s history.

I have decided to be more thorough in identifying the photographs in my own collection.  The process is ongoing. I have much to do.
