title: "A Different Take on the Dark Matter Theory"
---

- Astrophysicists are searching deep space for particles they have never seen they call Dark Matter in order to finally determine the origin of the universe.

- But as far as I’m concerned;
- It sometimes matters if you’re thinner or fatter
- It always matters if you’re happy or sadder
- It often matters if matter is really matter
- But what does it matter if matter is dark or light?
- Can dark matter improve my toothless bite?
- Can dark matter pay your delinquent bills?
- What can light matter do to cure our ills?
- After one billion years the stars will still scatter
- Since we’ll all be gone
- What will it matter?
