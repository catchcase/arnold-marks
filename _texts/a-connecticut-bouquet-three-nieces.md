title: "A Connecticut Bouquet (Three Nieces)"
---

- We’re leaving now 
- I’m taking Sandy home again. 
- The ride is long 
- And never fast.

- We’re leaving now 
- I’m driving Sandy home again. 
- Our eyes on the road 
- Our thoughts in the past.
- Little said,
- Little seen,
- As roads become tunnels of green. 
- Then she turns to me.

- “Everything grows better home,” she says. 
- “Apples are tastier, bigger, more red.” 
- “Flowers too grow better there,” she says. 
- Now she smiles and looks ahead.

- And so we’re on our way now. 
- I’m taking Sandy home again 
- To watch her flowers growing.
