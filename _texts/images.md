title: "Images"
---

- Consider my love 
- these images 
- streaking through my brain 
- like lasers in a holiday sky

- YOU and I 
- striding side by side
-  over barren plains
-  hour by hour
-  creating history lessons 
- for yet unborn generations

- IN a world spoiled by ruins
-  we struggle against chaos 
- emerging somehow alive 
- as equals 
- in every sense 
- as in the beginning

- I see us again and again
-  now riding side by side 
- on light beams back in time 
- ever seeking the truths 
- we somehow lost along the way
