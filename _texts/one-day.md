Gussie asked me: “Why haven’t I read any of your poetry lately?” And I said? “I haven’t been writing much lately.” After she smiled and said: “Well, anyway, keep writing.”

Later I found myself questioning why it is I haven’t been writing more poetry. Of course my first thought and the obvious answer was, I'm not a poet. If I had the gift surely the words would come easier, even endlessly. Imagine the poets one could name whose work was strong and prodigious even at the very end of their lives. Poets just never seem to run out of words.

In my case, I find poetry to be a very tough sport; much more challenging than others about which I had some personal experience. For me, words do not come easily and never endlessly.

What’s more, I have no idea why I even occasionally feel a desire to describe certain aspects of my life in a manner not ordinary. Especially since my life has been one not far displaced from that common measurement.

But here I am again trying like hell to interpret nothing more than a common reality in an uncommon way. Hoping perhaps by some literary mishap I might render something on a page meaningful enough to cause someone to question why she hadn’t read any of my poetry lately.

Thank you, Gussie.
