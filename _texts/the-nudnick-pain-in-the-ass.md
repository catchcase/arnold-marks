title: "The Nudnick (Pain in the Ass)"
---

When I saw him standing in line waiting for the same bus I as waiting for, I got this odd feeling the trip I booked to Atlantic City might not be all boredom as usual.

Don't ask why, it was just a feeling I had.

Maybe he got my attention because he didn't shuffle along like the rest of us, as if we were in line for the "Blue Plate Special". No! He spent more time out of line than in line, constantly looking back as If he was expecting someone he knew would be arriving shortly.

That was the beginning of it.

He appeared to be of middle age. His hair was thinning, he was clean shaven. A smile seemed indelibly drawn on his round, puffy face. It was a kind of smile that made me think; I wonder why he's smiling like that? And though it was a hot August evening, he wore a sport jacket, white shirt and tie. Yeah! That was the kicker. It was way too hot for jackets and ties on a crowed commuter bus in the summertime. Finally, a well-stuffed overnight bag hung freely from his shoulder.

The line began moving at a better pace now. I finally was able to take my seat in time to watch my fellow traveler hip hop up the several steps into the bus. "Here you are my good friend," he greeted the driver, bowing slightly presenting him with his ticket as if it was a significant donation to the Bus Drivers' Welfare Fund.

I felt a little nervous twitch when for a second I thought he was taking the seat next to mine. Fortunately, instead he stopped at the first row opposite the driver.

A little startled, I watched as he swung his bag directly over my head aiming for the luggage rack above me. Instinctively, I covered my head to prevent a possible miscalculation.

"Hi yah!" he chirped, obviously oblivious to the possibility the harm a slight error in his judgement could have caused. "Warm day, isn't it?" I nodded. What could I say? He already had me thinking like a turtle in the defensive mode.

I slouched down in my seat, pulling my Phillies hat to my eyebrows, my arms tucked 
against my chest trying to anticipate his next move.

Just as I was contemplating moving further to the rear of the bus, the gears thumped into reverse as we wheeled out of the terminal heading for the shore.

We had been on the road for only a short time when the individual I had already concluded was a Nudnick, stood up and began making his way to the toilet at the rear. The door slammed shut. When it slammed shut again I glanced down the aisle. He was making his way back to his seat, pausing occasionally to greet passengers, some very willing to respond to this friendly stranger who had adopted the aura of the local politician thanking his loyal constituents.

He nodded and smiled passing me. I nodded back, still in my turtle-like position. I watched him as he removed his jacket, folding it neatly on the vacant seat next to his seat. Why the seat next to his was vacant, I don't know. He carefully draped his tie over the railing that separated his seat from the stairwell. Now, I'm not prudish by any means, but I was somewhat surprised when he removed his shirt, folding it neatly on his jacket. He wasn't wearing an undershirt. He stowed his socks and shoes under his seat. Then methodically proceeded to fold his pants up at the hem, one hem at a time till he appeared to be wearing shorts. Then with a sigh, he adjusted his seat to the lounging position resting his feet on the restraining rail in front.

By this time the Nudnick had captured the driver's attention.

I wondered what took so long. He had been glancing up at his mirror. Finally, not able to restrain himself any longer, he shouted sharply, "You can't keep your legs up there sir!"

A moment of silence. The driver glanced at his mirror again, then the road, then the mirror.

"But my doctor said I could die If I don't keep my feet higher than my heart on long trips," the Nudnick countered. The driver's head jerked upward again. He actually turned slightly to get a better look at who it was questioning his authority.

But before he could respond again, he heard, "I know, I know â€” die," and with that verbal surrender the Nudnick removed his feet from the rail and put his seat in the upright position.

"And put your shirt back on too," the driver yelped, staring hard at the highway in front of his bus.

The Nudnick fell asleep with his head resting against the window. He woke up when the bus gently bumped the curb in the Atlantic City Bus Terminal.

Leaving the bus quickly, I decided to stop at Harry's Bar for a couple of vodkas and water to calm my nerves before heading home.
