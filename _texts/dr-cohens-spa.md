title: "Dr. Cohen's Spa"

Lately, I have come to believe my doctor's office, like the ancient temples of Eastern Mysticism, has evolved certain healing powers.

I visit my internist twice annually whether necessary or not. I feel better knowing I am at least making an effort to discover the origins of the unrelenting aches and pains that haunt me with predictable regularity. Is this what aging is all about, or is there something else going on here? I have to know.

On my last visit I was feeling particularly lousy. I felt I was on that downward slope, sliding to wherever I was sliding down to. You know the feeling: pain in every joint, tired most of the time, lower back pain (especially lower back pain), sore feet (especially sore feet), and that old standby, I.B.S. Did I forget something? I could go on.

But sitting there in that quiet, dimly-lit waiting room, in a chair more comfortable than most, mindlessly leafing through a two-month-old edition of some travel magazine, I began to feel my body relax.

Without lifting my head (so as not to appear too nosey), I glanced quickly around the room. There, sitting across was a woman with an obviously painful skin problem. Another patient in a rigid arm cast sat nearby. I wondered if I should be taking up the good doctor's time with my minor complaints.

I turned to a beautiful two-page color spread of green, rolling hills in some far off country or another. What a wonderful place to visit, I lied to myself. I concentrated with even more feigned diligence.

I was feeling very--relaxed now. Pain, what pain? My eyelids grew heavy. I felt as though I could nap. Had the treatment already begun? The nurse's abrupt invitation to follow her startled me.

Entering the examination room usually causes me at least some anxiety. But that day a certain calm took over.

The nurse was very efficient and businesslike. After only a few minutes in her capable hands, she gave me the result of her preliminary exam; pulse and blood pressure normal, no change from the previous cardiogram.

I thought it was amazing how much more attractive nurses are today than they were years ago. Then almost as an afterthought she told me I lost an inch in height since 2005.

I decided it would be futile to explain that the measuring instrument could not possibly account for the fact that I had more hair two years ago than I had that day. What did she know? I wondered if she was aware of the small, but very noticeable growth clinging to the side of her nose.

Now it was the doctor's turn. He said he needed to ask me a few questions in order to update my file. He assured me, by entering everything into his laptop, it would be unnecessary to ask the same questions in the future.

It sounded like a great idea to me because most of the questions always seemed rather silly anyway.

Questions like: "How many alcohol drinks do you consume in a week?" "When did you last have strong feelings of anger against someone?" "How often do you have sexual intercourse?" I swear that you needed to be a historian to answer some of these questions. I was glad when he finished.

Wasting no time, he asked me to lie down on the examination table. He began to press here and poke there, often in the very same places doctors always seem to like pressing and poking. "Does it hurt when I press here?", he asked. "Only when you press too hard," I replied. "Fine," he said curtly, obviously mistaking candor for disrespect.

"Now stand up straight; touch your toes," he commanded. "Now from the waist, bend to the right, now left, now back." "Good," he said, still unsmiling.

I was beginning to think this exam was a breeze, even fun, I thought. I was surprised at my newfound flexibility. For something faster than a fleeting instant, I even thought maybe I should come more often.

The visit was brief as usual.
	
I left the office that day feeling like Tom Hanks' character must have felt in my all-time favorite fairytale, BIG (not counting Bambi of course), as he exited the elevator in his workplace. Josh was smiling broadly, with a jaunty strut, swinging his briefcase with abandonment, after having spent his first ever romantic evening with his very attractive coworker. Did he click his heels in midair? I forget.

Anyway, in a few weeks I received the written results of the exam and blood work. It read, No abnormalitiesâ€”no changes.

My wife was somewhat perplexed by the diagnosis. I guess because she had spent the prior months having to listen to my constant bitching and moaning. She of course accepted the doctor's opinion, though somewhat reluctantly.

As for me, I anxiously look forward to my next visit to Doctor Cohen's Spa to get to the bottom of my 
problems once and for all. That is: if I live that long.
