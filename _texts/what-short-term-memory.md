title: "What Short-Term Memory"
---

Someone recently suggested my short-term memory “isn’t what it used to be.”  At first I sort of brushed off the idea.  But I later concluded there could be some truth in the notion.  I even spent sometime thinking about it.  Not very long mind you; I don’t spend a lot of time these days thinking about any one thing anymore.

Maybe I do spend an inordinate amount of time daydreaming about the past. I find it very satisfying, even fun at times reserving at least some small portion of my remaining time on this planet, in the past. Since I can daydream in only one dimension at a time, one might notice a slight deficit in one dimension or another.
 For instance, quite unexpectedly, while sitting in a theater, an image of my “Big Sister” escorting me to New York’s Paramount Theater to see a very young Frank Sinatra spills over the edge of my latent memory pool. The occasion turned out to be my introduction to popular music.  I fondly recall the incident though details faded long ago.

And why should I choose to limit my “recall’ ability to the trivia of the day when I can call up at will visions of a nail-biting sail to Bimini on Al Kramer’s sailboat in the seventies on a heaving ocean of giant swells after a storm.  And the feeling of relief and excitement as the island appeared as if magically through the heavy morning mist.

What real harm is done should I misplace the extra set of keys or some other innocuous item when I can picture in my mind hot summer days on white sandy beaches with family and friends; the happiest holidays; the birth of children, vacations always ending too soon; and the feelings of love coming from unexpected corners of my universe.
