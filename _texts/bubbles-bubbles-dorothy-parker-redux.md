title: "Bubbles, Bubbles (Dorothy Parker Redux)"
---

- If your marriage is in trouble
-  and you feel you’re in a bubble 
- listen well my dears to what I have to say.

- No need to feel so guilty 
- just sell off all the Realty 
- and book a flight to some subtropic cay.

- Now should you feel my tack too risky
-  or think it just a touch too frisky 
- there’s yet another bearing you may take.

- Put aside your gnawing troubles 
- just continue blowing bubbles
-  and pray someday your mate will blow away.
