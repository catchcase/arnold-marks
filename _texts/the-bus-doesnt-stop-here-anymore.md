title: "The Bus Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"
---

The 5:35 a.m. express to Philadelphia was less than an hour out of Atlantic City when an elderly lady wearing a summer print dress with a mismatched sweater walked from the rear of the bus to the stainless steel pole just behind the driver.
	
I guessed she was well into her eighth decade; not aging very well.  An abundance of white hair was wrapped in a tight bun piled high on her head.  I envisioned her rocking contentedly on a screened porch somewhere watching the rest of the world go by.

Instead, here she was, alone, early in the morning on a rush hour bus headed to the Big City.  There she stood, holding tightly to the polished pole with one hand and in the other a large shopping bag made of plastic netting.  Across the top in red letters it read: “A Souvenir of Atlantic City”.

For a time she stood motionless; bent over slightly as if trying to regain her bearings.

I watched her from my aisle seat two rows back opposite the driver.  An elderly man with a bamboo cane sat almost directly behind her.  Next to him sat a woman in the window seat.

“Driver”, the old lady began in a disarming, almost apologetic tone, “This doesn’t seem to be the way to Philadelphia.  I haven’t recognized anything along this road. Isn’t this the road to the airport?”

The driver automatically glanced at his mirror to get a fix on this person standing behind him when he suddenly realized she was standing much too close.

“Lady, he began with deliberate authority in his voice and demeanor, “I’ve been making this run for a long time now, trust me.  This is the road to Philadelphia.”

With that the old lady glanced to one side of the road, leaning forward, almost touching the driver.  Still leaning forward, she stared at the opposite side.

“But where are all the buildings?”  she asked.  “Where are all those houses?”

By this time the driver knew he had a problem.  He was obviously trying to remain calm.  “This road is fairly new, madam.  If you’ll return to your seat I promise to get you where you’re going in good time.”

Still she held her position.  Standing straight up now, still staring down at the road.

“Driver”, she began again noticeably even more annoyed, “I must get to Philadelphia very soon.”

By now the driver had become more agitated by this Rockwellian sliver of a woman daring to question his competence concerning his long well-practiced routine.

“I’ll get you there if you will just return to your seat”. “Please”, the driver implored, his patience now approaching zero level.”

“But this is the wrong way,” she insisted, “I want to get off this bus right now,” she demanded.   Her voice becoming louder and more animated.

Taking his eyes off the road for the first time the driver turned in his seat.  The look on his face was one of incredulity.

Now pleading, he said, “Lady, this is an express bus to Philadelphia.  I could get fired for letting you leave this bus on the Expressway.”

Still staring straight ahead she sobbed, “But I must get off the bus now.  I took a laxative last night and I must get to a bathroom immediately”

At that instant, the driver’s foot apparently slipped off the gas pedal.  The sudden reduction in speed caught the passengers by surprise.  To avoid a collision, I had to brace myself with both hands on the back of the seat in front of me.

The old man with the cane sitting behind the old lady stood up quickly, his cane in hand as if the seat had become unbearably hot.  He moved quickly to the rear of the bus.  The lady sitting next to him sank low in her seat, pressing hard against the side of the bus as if trying to exit a door that wasn’t there.

“Aw come on”, the driver playfully prodded in a final effort to reconcile the situation.

Confident of support from her fellow passengers the old lady turned to face the rear of the bus. Her little round glasses rested low on her nose.

Her eyes opened wide in an expression of utter disbelieve, as if to say: Is he kidding?

Turning back to the driver she repeated, “I must get off this bus now.”

Fortunately for all of us, an exit sign appeared a short distance down the Expressway.  The driver parked at the off ramp.

From the bus we could see a service station across from the exit ramp on the access road below.

The driver helped the old lady down the ramp.  He was back quickly.  He announced he would call his office to make sure she would be picked up by the next local which he assured us would be along shortly.

Mumbling under his breath, still shaking his head in disbelief, the driver dropped heavily back into his seat.

The last time I saw the old lady she was walking briskly to the service station.

I wondered if the bus could still be on time, and I wondered too if the old lady with her souvenir shopping bag would be on time.
