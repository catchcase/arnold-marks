title: "The Cat Lady of Belle Haven Court"
---

By 1946 my friends and I had already lived through ten or eleven Halloweens.  That was during the time Davey Frolow, Harry Segal and I first met the old lady who lived in the “Court”. 

By that time, we thought we knew just about everything we would ever need to know about witches. We saw them often in movies and comic books in their black clothes and capes that waved in the wind. And pointed hats that managed to stay on no mater how windy. And of course there was the magic broom they used to get to places in a hurry. 

When we first noticed her, we were convinced we had met a real live, homegrown, dyed-in-the-black-robe witch. Right in our own neighborhood. As far as we were concerned, she had all the familiar signs. Since we agreed she was mean, ugly and hating kids was all the additional evidence we needed. That first time we happened to see her standing on her front step, broom in hand, was enough to send us running down the street, fearing any second she would launch herself in our direction. 

But as it turned out, as time passed, we began questioning whether this strange looking person really was a witch after all. 

The fact she didn’t seem to favor black clothes became a problem for us. She often wore long, narrow dresses of all different colors. She was tall and thin. Her face was thin too. You couldn’t tell if she was wearing shoes because her dresses were so long. We never saw her smile until much later. I guess when she knew we were around she didn’t feel much like smiling. 

Over time, after much discussion which inevitably morphed into arguments and occasionally even wrestling matches, we finally concluded we were not dealing with a witch after all. But instead, someone who only looked and acted like a witch. 

This person who became known by the neighborhood kids as the “Cat Lady” lived in a little house in a place called “Belle Haven Court”. 

“Belle Haven” was one of many “Places”, “Terraces” and “Courts” in Atlantic City’s Inlet section. They were usually small enclaves cleverly tucked away in often unexpected places. Probably a supervention of City Fathers of another day deciding it good policy to squeeze as many people as possible onto the Island of Absecon. 

The Court consisted of two rows of four, two-story attached houses. They were tiny with sharp roof-lines reminiscent of an old European village. A narrow “planter” separated the two rows. A high wooden fence at one end was encased in a spectacular growth of Morning Glory vines in summer and, at the opposite end, a narrow walkway guided residents and visitors into the complex from the sidewalk on Atlantic Avenue. 

The unintended seclusion of the Court tended to ascribe a certain aura of anonymity to its residents. 

Most year-round residents lived in multifamily buildings along with a dozen or more other families.  It was common to spend hot summer nights sitting “out front” taking advantage of cool ocean breezes. People got to know their neighbors pretty well, even though not everyone said hello as they walked past. We thought it strange we never noticed the “Cat Lady" walk past. We never saw her in Doc Valinskys’ Drugstore or Caplans’ Grocery or Dannenbaums’ Bakery. 

But we knew she lived in one of those little houses in the Court along with all those other strangers tucked away in their private places, hardly ever noticed by anyone. 

We thought the whole scene was almost supernatural. Maybe we did over-kidicise the situation, but that’s how it appeared to us; that’s how I remember it.

Then there were all those cats! Cats everywhere! They lounged on every windowsill of her house. When she stood outside her door, they pushed one another aside trying to wrap themselves around her ankles. A few always crouched under the bushes surrounding the perimeter of her tiny yard as if ready to pounce on any intruder. It was a vision strange enough to excite any kids’ imagination.

If it wasn’t for a “tag” game we played in the cooler months of the year, we might never have met the “Cat Lady” in the first place. Unlucky for her she lived in the wrong place at the wrong time.

“Hipper” was a tag game better played at night; preferably moonless nights.  The unique aspect of the game that separated the “little squirts” from the “big kids” was that “boundaries” might encompass an entire square block or more. The extent of boundaries often contributed to wild evenings.

It was common for a startled resident to phone the police to investigate noises in a building hallway or the clanging and crashing of trash cans on a fire escape or in a back yard when there wasn’t supposed to be any noises.

Unlucky for the Cat Lady our game usually began just a few feet from her front door. It just happened to be a centrally located shortcut to all the best hiding places. The low fence separating her yard from the adjacent alley was for us just too tempting to ignore. We were mysteriously drawn to that little fence. Maybe because it was so easy to roll over. But more likely it had to do with us realizing how much our very presence ticked her off.

More than once I heard her scream out from behind her screen door in a high-pitched, portentous voice, “you bad boys, stop running through my yard or I’ll tell your parents”. Or some similar threat we found easy to ignore. Her age no doubt prevented a more demonstrative response.

But as far as we were concerned, what could happen? It was all about a game and having fun. Besides, we were on our turf and we could do whatever we felt like doing. At least, that was our attitude.

In the warmer months, in the summer, little thought was given to the Cat Lady or tag games. Our time was spent on the beach, the ballfields or the boardwalk. During those days, a kind of truce existed between her and our little “coven” of trouble makers.

But summers always ended too soon and October and school and eventually Halloween once again became central to our daily activities. We were growing up and becoming accustomed to change; realizing a new season would bring new fun and new adventure.

The “eve” of All Saints Day for us seemed to be the most celebrated of all the holidays. It was the holiday especially for kids. Not everyone celebrated Easter or Christmas or other religious holidays, but it seemed like everyone acknowledged Halloween. Nearly everyone’s door was open to the neighborhood kids for a few hours that one evening. Maybe it had something to do with the “small town” mentality of the time. After all, Atlantic City’s “Inlet Section” took on the feel of a small town once all the tourists left. Or possibly the recent end of The War magnified feelings of gratitude and generosity towards one’s neighbors. For whatever reason, we kids were the benefactors at that time, on that fun evening. 

Of course deciding what costume to wear was always the challenge of the day. Because we thought they “looked silly”, and we could do better ourselves, ready-made costumes were never even considered. We preferred improvising a “scarecrow” or “movie monster” or one of the newly created “super heroes” of the comic books. Our parents went along with our imagination as long as it didn’t cost much. I guess that was a lesson in itself. The best costume was one that most effectively disguised the person behind the mask. Not as simple as it sounds. 

Unlike today, we went “beggin”, not “trick or treating”; patiently waiting in an open doorway until the “offering” was deposited. Conversation was purposely ignored because it only retarded our progress. The idea was to collect as much “stuff” as possible. 

On this particular evening, we started at the top floor of the Saint Clair Apartments. That’s where I lived. Everyone in the building knew one another well. Most of the kids were already out on the street in their costumes. It was always a good place to start. 

Next we went to the apartment house next door. We thought it strange the foyer lights were out and the door was locked. There was always an exception. 

Oh well!  No matter. The idea was to keep moving. 

Then came the entrance to Belle Haven Court. 

Naturally, we hesitated.

 Looking down the length of the walkway we could see lots of lights; and kids were going in and coming out the entranceway. After discussing all the reasons we shouldn’t go, we decided to go anyway. Apparently, even fear couldn’t prevent us from accomplishing our mission.

 The first thing we saw was a long line of kids, some with their moms, standing in front of all places the Cat Lady’s door.

 There she stood in the open doorway; a box lay on the floor beside her.

 Again, we paused to discuss the reasons we should keep moving. The kids’ moms were looking us over. The line was moving slowly. The old lady was smiling and greeting each kid by name before dropping a bag into their “treat bags”. Each kid got a whole bag of stuff! Imagine that, a whole bag. We decided to get in line with the little squirts.

 After what seemed to be too long, our turn finally came. There was no one behind us. We thought that was kind of strange.

 There we were face-to-face with our bitterest antagonist in the neighborhood, except maybe for Mister Pritzer, who happened to own a lot of the fences we climbed over on our regular “shortcut” routes.

 She was tall alright, looking down at the three of us, her eyes squinting over the thin gold rims of her little round glasses.

 “The box is empty; if you boys want anything you’ll have to come inside for a minute”, she said with a hint of exasperation in her voice. She picked up the empty box as she turned to go inside.

 Confident in our disguises, not even considering she might have recognized us and was about to turn us into the police, or even worse, our Parents, we followed her.

 Greed was just too overpowering.

 Just as we imagined, there were cats all over the place.

 Some lounged on the carpeted stairs, their heads turning, as if on axels, following our every move. The ones in the living room scampered away, taking refuge under stuffed chairs and a couch. A few disappeared in an instant “flying” up the stairs. While still others stretched lazily on the kitchen counter, their tails hanging over the edge moving in that mysterious rhythm known only to felines. 

Knowing how many cats lived in the house was hard to tell; we guessed at least two dozen. Maybe we exaggerated a little. Yet, the little house was well kept and surprisingly had no offensive smells. The only noticeable odor was one of paint coming from the living room. I recognized that smell immediately because my father had ritually painted our kitchen cabinets almost every year before the High Holy Days. 

In one corner of the room stood an artist’s easel. A tin can full of paintbrushes of all shapes and sizes hung off to one side on a string. An unfinished painting leaned on the easel’s ledge. And crowding both walls of the tiny room from floor-to-ceiling were paintings; most of equal size. Some were pictures of brightly colored flowers, like those in the planter just outside the living room window and on the wooden fence a few doors down. But most were pictures of cats in all colors and many different poses. The models and admirers were all around us. 

The whole scene was so unexpected I think the three of us must have fallen into a temporary state of shock. Our costumes masked the emotion I knew we all felt. I also believe it took all our willpower to keep our mouths shut. No one made a sound. 

I can’t remember exactly what the old lady put in our bags that evening; not that it matters. If it was a bag of something I would probably remember. When she finished, she turned and began walking towards the door not looking back even once to see if we were following. She knew we were obviously as anxious to leave as she was to be rid of us.

 “Now you be good boys”, she said, closing the screen door behind us. “Be good boys”, she repeated, raising her voice a little louder from behind the closed door as we made our way out to the Atlantic Avenue sidewalk. Somehow this was a familiar scene to me, only the words were different. 

Continuing on our Halloween adventure, we all agreed any curiosity we might have had about the “strangers in the Court” had been more than satisfied that evening.  It was only later I came to understand that there was more to the old lady’s parting words than we realized at the time. Maybe our disguises were less effective than we thought? 

I remember that Halloween of 1946 as the best Halloween any kid could ever have! It also happened to be the last time my friends and I went “beggin”. From that year on, we left beggin to all the little squirts. 

The next year on Halloween several of the girls we knew in the neighborhood had a party in the basement of Irene Dubrows’ house on the corner of Vermont and Atlantic Avenues.  We played Pin the Tail on the Donkey; we bobbed for apples, and ended the evening with a new game called Spin the Bottle. 

It was even more fun than “beggin" .

We still played Hipper for a couple of more years. 

I don’t remember why, but we decided to move the starting area farther down the street; toward the Lighthouse and away from the little fence in the alley. There was no discussion about it; we just did it. 

Halloween, Hipper and the Cat Lady of Belle Haven Court; one of those sweet times to remember.
