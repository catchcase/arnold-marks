title: "A Head Song"
---

- Late one night
- I lay in bed
- as a tune played softly in my head
- the melody was sweet
- like one by Kerns
- It sounded like
- {:.indent-1}Hum-Hum-De-Dum-Dum-Dum
- and the words said
- {:.indent-1}love is the absence of loneliness
- and I listened to the rhythm in my head
- and the rhythm felt like
- {:.indent-1}tat-tat-ta-tat-tat-tat
- then it all came together in s a song
- and the song said
- {:.indent-1}love is the absence of loneliness
- {:.indent-1}love is the absence of loneliness
- have you heard the melody?
- Do you know the words?
- Can you recall that rhythm?
