title: "Another Reunion"
---

- Remember the day you met an old schoolmate 
- as you walked along a city sidewalk or in line 
- for the theater, or in some restaurant? 
- Remember how you both got a little carried away
-  joking, laughing, recalling those wonderful years? 
- Then all too soon you said,
-  “Goodbye, I hope we meet again soon.”
-  But somehow you never did meet again. 
- Remember the last time we met? 
- We joked and laughed, 
- and in time too short we said, 
- “Goodbye, I hope we meet again soon.
- ” But the years passed and we never met.
-  Now we will meet again at our Reunion 
- with yet another chance
-  to tell that same sweet lie.
