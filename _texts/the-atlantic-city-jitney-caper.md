title: "The Atlantic City Jitney Caper"
---

The incident was over in a matter of minutes more than fifty-six years ago, but when we get together, we still talk about it.

Last week my old friend Cappy Benowitz and his wife were in Philly bonding with a new grandchild and he repeated the story once again. He claimed to remember everything, well, almost everything. He would never admit it, and I still hesitate to openly suggest it, but I always felt he was the real instigator. Why else would his memory be so sharp?

Atlantic City in the winter of 1948 was a very quiet town. One would ordinarily expect a summer resort to lose at least some small portion of its intrinsic glamour in the “off season”. In those days though, it appeared to many in the business community, every year was getting worse than the one before. And to most working adults struggling to raise families, the decline in the economic health of the city was becoming a critical problem.

But as far as the kids in town were concerned, life could never have been better. It was the happiest of times. To us, winter, like constipation, was merely a temporary affliction we had to bear until summer returned.

Summers, always too brief, provided us with a vast playground of beaches and ballfields, back bays and basketball courts and of course, that wonderful man-made phenomenon called the “Boardwalk”. And when summer was over, the almost mystical stillness of winter gave us all the feeling the City was ours alone.

On those days when icy winds from the north rushed down the avenues and “The Walk” like an invisible surf, people just seemed to disappear. A once bustling, crowded city became a quiet little town. At least that’s the way it appeared to us.

It was that kind of a cold, misty Sunday in mid January when the “incident” went down.

Cappy said there were five of us playing basketball behind Zwiebachs’ candy store on New Hampshire Avenue that afternoon. He knew for certain Danny Richbaum and Booty Miltivic were there, along with Murray Starky and me. Cappy made it five.

The courts at Altman Field behind Zwiebachs was where we spent much of our spare time on most days. After playing basketball for several hours on that infamous day, we were all sweaty, wet and worn out. Our winter jackets did little to keep the cold wind away from our damp underwear. It was decided we had to find shelter soon, or head home. Heading home was rarely a first choice. Often someone’s brother or sister, or even a parent had to come looking for one of us just before the sun went down.

The candy store was not an option since Zwiebachs’ son would hover over us like an attacking eagle, ever so slowly escorting us to the door as our money ran out. He was taught well. Fortunately, for him, he was rarely seen walking around the neighborhood unescorted.

Cappy said, just when we were going to split, Murray jokingly suggested we could sneak into one of the new jitneys to get out of the cold. It so happened, he only lived a block or so from the jitney lot, which he walked by regularly. One morning on his way to school, he had noticed a driver enter his vehicle by merely pushing on the two vertical panels that was the door.

Now, you have to understand, this all took place during the period when the old Packard and DeSoto limousine-type automobiles were being phased out, and the modern bus-like jitneys of today were coming on line. These new vehicles were radically different from the old; they were sleek looking and very fascinating to twelve and thirteen year old boys. And, they were parked just across the street from our turf.

Not surprisingly, that afternoon, the lot and the streets were pretty much deserted.

Murray, with the rest of us following close behind, began walking toward one of the buses parked close to the Pacific Avenue driveway. As we approached, he flipped the basketball he was carrying to Booty Miltivic, then with both hands pushed hard against the plastic and rubber door. The panels spread inward and apart with almost welcome ease. Each of us tried pushing each other aside to be first to enter this new and interesting domain.

Booty went straight to the rear seat stretching out his long frame while holding the basketball tightly against his chest. Danny and I jumped to the two single window seats, opposite the driver, while Cappy secured the spot behind Murray, who had already made himself at home in the driver’s seat.

Having escaped the wind, we were all soon feeling cozy and comfortable, admiring the latest improvements to the city’s transportation system.

The conversation became loud and animated. We no doubt talked mostly about girls and the upcoming games at the J.C.C., unfinished homework assignments, along with the teachers responsible for the neglect, and how the Phillies stacked up against the Athletics in the coming spring season.

Then according to Cappy, the whole thing really got started when Murray suddenly turned in his seat with his arm raised high in the air.  Between his thumb and forefinger was a key which he displayed as one might hold a cup at an afternoon tea social.

“Look what I found,” he said grinning menacingly with his hand still high, waving the key teasingly.

Suddenly, Booty, sitting up now, screamed, “Oh shit, the ignition key,” at the same time bouncing the basketball hard against the low ceiling of the bus.

Danny Richbaum mumbled something about how late it was getting and how he had to get home and pee.

As for me, I could feel myself falling into the grip of abject fear, floating white dots and all, which I suppose is why I had to defer to Cappy’s memory for many of the facts of this story.

Nevertheless, I do distinctly remember seeing Cappy Benowitz jumping up and down ln his seat yelling, “son-of-a-bitch, let’s go for a ride”.

That was all Murray needed to hear. Cappy had pulled the trigger. Before anyone could react, the engine was running and Murray had the five of us moving south down the Pacific Avenue jitney route.  Each of us now conspirators in the crime of vehicular theft, along with any number of additional charges a judge might choose to conjure up.

Anyone observing the scene would have thought it strange indeed.

What made it even more unusual was Murray’s demeanor. He had apparently slipped into the persona of a jitney driver. As if at that hour, and on that day, he was merely doing his normal job. This was his shift, and damned if he wasn’t enjoying it immensely.

As for his passengers — silence. All eyes riveted on the street ahead. Hands white from squeezing hard on the cold, steel handrails.

Each undoubtedly contemplating that instant when life would end in a blazing head-on crash with the first oncoming vehicle.

Miraculously, nothing happened. Nor were there any oncoming cars to be seen. If we had been stopped by a police officer, it would have been for driving too slowly down a main thoroughfare. Thankfully, there was no police officer.

Murray had the jitney under complete control. Later, someone questioned where he learned to drive so well. No one seemed to know the answer, not even Murray.

After traveling several blocks, a small stooped-over figure appeared beside the jitney stop sign at the next intersection. An out stretched arm was signaling us to stop.

Preparing to accommodate his first paying customer of the day, Murray slowed down even more, aiming for the high curbside.

Danny, by this time In a state of extreme agitation, yelled, “Don’t stop you idiot, keep going!” But it was too late. Murray, the “jitney driver” had already stopped the bus and opened the door.

A little old man in an ankle length overcoat with a scarf secured around his head and ears began struggling to pull himself up the high step. Murray, his head turned slightly away, extended his cupped hand to receive the twenty-five-cent fare.

Seemingly in a single motion, he tossed the change onto the rug-covered engine access hatch, yanking on the mechanical door closer, practically kicking his passenger into the bus, then shifted into first gear. Again the jitney began moving slowly down the street.

Booty said later that the old man was cursing Murray the rest of the time for not waiting until he sat down.

Then it happened. The traffic light changed to red at the next intersection.

At precisely the same time, another jitney was approaching from the opposite direction.

Because we were moving so slowly, it got to the corner just before we pulled up to the curb.

Cappy said by this time panic had become palpable. There we were, facing each other no more than 40 feet apart waiting for the light to turn green.

The real jitney driver by this time was hanging dangerously out of his small side window, trying to get close enough to see who was driving this renegade bus. This bus full of passengers, when he knew for certain there were no fares to be had on this cold January day.

Murray casually waved to him while facing me, as if we were having a conversation. The light turned green.

The curious driver sped past with gears grinding, never taking his eyes off of us.

It was then someone yelled, "Open the door and let me outa here.”

With that, as if on command, Murray again yanked the door open.

When last seen, the old man was still mumbling obscenities under his breath as we all exited the jitney with even more enthusiasm than when we first entered.

Danny and Booty went their separate way ln the direction of the Boardwalk. Once there, home was only minutes away.

While Cappy, Murray and I headed briskly toward Labels’ Pinball Machine Parlor at South Carolina and Atlantic Avenues, I am not certain how much time we spent there, but I remember my clothes were dry by the time we left.

We will never know for sure why the police were never called to hunt down the perpetrators of what was a serious misdemeanor.

We concluded that the owner of the jitney never filed a complaint because he feared ridicule from his peers for leaving his door unlocked with the key in the ignition.

As for the old man, smiles still come when we speculate how long he sat there alone cursing the driver before he realized there was no driver, and that the jitney would never get him to his destination.

That afternoon Murray won twenty-five dollars at Labels on his
favorite pinball machine.

Reviewing the unlikely events of the day as we walked home toward the city’s “Inlet Section”, we all agreed that twenty-five dollars and twenty-five cents was a decent payday for a novice jitney driver.

*For Murray*
